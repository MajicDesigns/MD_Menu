\mainpage MD_Menu Library
Menu Manager for 1 or 2 Line Displays
------------------------------

This is a menu management library created as a front end to set 
parameters in embedded hardware control applications, leaving the 
back end under application control. It is suitable for text based 
displays (eg, LCD modules) with 1 or 2 lines available for display.

The library allows user code to define
- Static menu definitions to minimized RAM footprint. 
- Callbacks for navigation and display control.
- Menu inactivity timeout.
- Auto start on key press or manual start by user code.
- Input methods available for
  + Boolean (Y/N) values.
  + Pick List selection.
  + Signed integers.
  + Decimal floating point representation.
  + Engineering units.

Menu managers in embedded systems are generally not the main function 
of the embedded application software, so this library minimizes the 
use of RAM and has a small memory footprint overall, leaving more space 
for what really matters.

\page pageUsingLibrary Using the Library
The MD_Menu library allows definition and navigation of a menu system by moving 
between the menu nodes. At a leaf node, MD_Menu can either manage editing values 
or call user code.

Menu structures are defined in PROGMEM memory. They are linked into tree structures 
relationships using the IDs of other menu nodes nodes or leaf nodes. Leaf nodes 
are always associated with a user variable.

Extensive use is made of callbacks to user code to manage user input, display
output and getting/setting values for variables.

## User Input for Menu Navigation

Menu navigation is carried out under the control of user code invoked as
a callback routine. The code must comply with the *cbUserNav* function 
prototype. This callback routine implementation is dependent on the type 
of input hardware, but the return codes for the required actions must 
be one of the standardized *userNavAction_t* enumerated type.

Navigation is carried out with 4 keys:
- **INCREMENT** (NAV_INC). Move down a menu, move to the next value 
in a pick list or increment a numeric value being edited.
- **DECREMENT** (NAV_DEC). Move up a menu, move to the previous value 
in a pick list or decrement a numeric value being edited.
- **SELECT** (NAV_SEL). Select the current menu or pick list item, or 
confirm an edited numeric value.
- **ESCAPE** (NAV_ESC). Escape the current menu (back up one level) or
cancel changes to an edited value.

A variety of input hardware setups are demonstrated in the Test 
example code provided.

Menu Display
------------
Menu display is enabled by user code as a callback routine from the 
library. The callback must comply with the *cbUserDisplay* function 
prototype.

The callback is provided with a request of type *userDisplayAction_t* and 
a message to display.

Display hardware must be able to display one or two lines for the menu 
display. All menu screens are structured with the first line as title 
and the second as the current menu selection or currently edited value, 
as appropriate. If the display can only support one line, the first line 
is discarded and only the second line displayed.

A variety of display hardware setups are demonstrated in the Test 
example code provided.

Memory Footprint
----------------
The limited amount of RAM available in micro controllers is a challenge for
menu systems, as they often contain large amounts of 'static' data as text 
labels and other status information.

The MD_Menu library uses statically allocated data located in PROGMEM for 
the menu system and only copies the current menu record into RAM. All user 
values reside in user code and are not duplicated in the library.

Menu Management
---------------
![Data Structure Map] (Data_Structures.jpg "Data Structure Map")

As shown in the figure above, the library uses three types of objects, each
identified with a unique id within the object type. A menu header (of 
type *mnuHeader_t*) defines a menu. The header contains a label for the title and
the range of menu items (of type *mnuItem_t*) that should be displayed for 
the menu. Menu item ids between the start and end id locations include 
all the ids in locations in between, and should be in number sequence.

A menu item may lead to another menu (MNU_MENU, if it is a node in the menu tree)
an input item (of type *mnuInput_t*) if it is a leaf of the menu system (MNU_INPUT),
or an input item with real-time feedback (MNU_INPUT_FB) that reports the value each 
time with every change of value. The depth of the menu tree is restricted by the 
defined MENU_STACK_SIZE constant. When this limit is exceeded, the library will 
just ignore requests that cause additional menu depth but continues to run.

Menu input items define the type of value that is to be edited by the user and
parameters associated with managing the input for that value. Before the value
is edited a callback following the *cbValueRequest* prototype is called to 'get'
the pointer to the variable with the current value. The input item id is provided 
to identify which value is being requested. The data must be loaded into a *value_t* 
data structure that remains in scope while the data is being edited, and the 
pointer to the structure passed back to the library. This copy of the user variable 
is used for editing and a second *cbValueRequest* (conceptually a 'set') is invoked 
after the value is updated, enabling the user code to take action on the change. 
If the variable edit is cancelled, the second *cbValueRequest* 'set' call does not 
occur and no further action is required from the user code. If the edit is specified 
with real-time feedback, the value is 'set' for each change in value. 

Variable data input may be of the following types:
- **Pick List** specifies a PROGMEM character string with list items separated
by the '|' character (defined as INPUT_SEPARATOR), for example "Apple|Orange|Pear".
The list is specified as the pList parameter and the get/set value callback expects
a value that is the index of the current selection (zero based).
- **Boolean** for Input of boolean (Y/N) values. As the user makes changes, the
value changes between displays of 'Y' and 'N' (defined as INP_BOOL_T and INP_BOOL_F).
The get/set callback expects a 0/1 value.
- **Integer** values can 8, 16 or 32 bits in size, with the get/set callback expecting 
int32_t (note all signed values). The input specification also allows a lower and upper 
bound to be set, as well as the number's base (2 through 16) to be specified. Numeric 
values that overflow the specified field with are prefixed by the '#' character (defined 
as INP_NUMERIC_OVERFLOW) to indicate that this has occurred.
- **Floating point** where the library uses a 32 bit long integer and assumes 
the last 2 digits (defined by FLOAT_DECIMALS) to be the fraction after the decimal 
point (character defined as DECIMAL_POINT). Specification allows lower and upper bound 
to be set. The base specification field is used to represent the minimum increment or 
decrement of the fractional component of value input (ie, with 2 decimals, 1 is .01, 5 
is .05, 50 is 0.50, etc).
- **Engineering Units** where the library uses a 32 bit long integer and assumes 
the last 3 digits (defined by ENGU_DECIMALS) to be the fraction after the decimal 
point (character defined as DECIMAL_POINT). Specification allows lower and upper bound for 
power of 10. Units are defined in the pList parameter. The base specification field is used 
to represent the minimum increment or decrement of the fractional component of value 
input (ie, with 3 decimals, 1 is .001, 5 is .005, 50 is 0.050, etc).
- **Run Code** specifies input fields that are designed to execute a user function
when selected. The 'get' in the callbask determines whether the operation requires confirmation.
Returning a null pointer implies confirmation, anything else is a direct execution of the 
user code. User code is only ever executed as part of the 'set' invocation.
- **External Input** specifies that the input value is provided by external user code. 
The value callback 'get' function is invoked until the value is confirmed using the normal
method for the menu. All values are 32 bit signed integers.
